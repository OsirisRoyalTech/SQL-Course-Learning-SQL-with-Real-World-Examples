An INNER JOIN returns records that have matching values in both tables.

Example:
  SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentID;

5.2 Left Join
A LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.

Example:
  SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentID;

5.3 Right Join
A RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.

Example:
  SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
  FROM Employees
  RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentID;

5.4 Full Join
A FULL JOIN returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
