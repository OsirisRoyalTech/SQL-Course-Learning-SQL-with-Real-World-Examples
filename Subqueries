6.1 Using Subqueries in SELECT
Subqueries are queries within queries. A subquery can return a single value, a list of values, or a table.

Example:
  SELECT FirstName, LastName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);

This retrieves employees whose salary is greater than the average salary.

6.2 Subqueries with EXISTS, IN, and NOT IN
•	EXISTS: Checks for the existence of rows returned by the subquery.
•	IN: Filters based on values returned by the subquery.
•	NOT IN: Filters out values returned by the subquery.

Example:
-- Using EXISTS
  SELECT FirstName, LastName
  FROM Employees
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Departments WHERE Departments.DepartmentID = Employees.Department);

-- Using IN
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'HR');
