4.1 BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL
You can refine queries with advanced filters:
•	BETWEEN: Filters data within a range.
•	IN: Filters data that matches any of the specified values.
•	LIKE: Filters data using pattern matching.
•	IS NULL: Filters data for NULL values.

Examples:
-- BETWEEN
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000;

-- IN
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department IN ('HR', 'Finance');

-- LIKE
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';

-- IS NULL
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department IS NULL;
4.2 Combining Conditions with AND, OR
You can combine multiple conditions using AND and OR.

Example:
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'HR' AND Salary > 50000;
