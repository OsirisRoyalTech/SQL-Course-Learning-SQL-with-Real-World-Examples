3.1 COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
SQL provides aggregate functions to perform calculations on data.
•	COUNT(): Returns the number of rows.
•	SUM(): Returns the sum of a numeric column.
•	AVG(): Returns the average value of a numeric column.
•	MIN(): Returns the minimum value of a column.
•	MAX(): Returns the maximum value of a column.

Example:
  SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(Salary), MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;

This query returns the total number of employees, the average salary, and the highest salary.

3.2 Grouping Data with GROUP BY
The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.

Example:
  SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) FROM Employees GROUP BY Department;

This query returns the average salary per department.
